# Yelp Data!

Instructions: 

1. Download the data files (business.json and checkin.json from here): 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ocj64t247ts3bzy/AAC4OUtg_t8u5TY3wQRH0HgNa?dl=0

2. Clone this git repo, then store the downloaded json files into the same directory.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory with the notebooks + data files.

4. In your terminal, type in 'jupyter notebook.' If you don't have it installed, download here: http://jupyter.org/install

4. You can now run Data Preprocessing ML.ipynb in the notebook. From this notebook, 'restaurants_data' and 'yelp_data' are generated. However, you can run all of the models without doing that as I have provided these files for you.

5. You can now run Restaurant ML.ipynb to run and compare the various different models that we built for this data.

Have fun!
