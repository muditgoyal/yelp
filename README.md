# Yelp Data!

Instructions: 

1. Download the data files (business.json and checkin.json from here): 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ocj64t247ts3bzy/AAC4OUtg_t8u5TY3wQRH0HgNa?dl=0

2. Clone this git repo, then store the downloaded json files into the same repository.

3. Open terminal, type in 'jupyter notebook' if you have it installed. If not, download here: http://jupyter.org/install

4. Run Data Preprocessingm ML.ipynb in the notebook. From this notebook, 'restaurants_data' and 'yelp_data' should be generated. However, you can run all of the models without doing that as I have provided these files for you.

5. You can run all of the Restaurant ML code to view all of the models.

Have fun!
